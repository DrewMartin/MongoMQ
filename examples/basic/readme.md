What is this demo
-----------------
This is a basic Hello World example.  If you send in your name to the hello listener it returns "Hello <your name>!" otherwise it returns "Hello world!".

How to use the basic demo
=========================
Open two console windows.  In one start the hello listner using:
  node sayhello

In the second window run the talker app using:
  node talker

Now enter your name and watch the "Hello <your name>!" response come back, or just press <enter> and watch "Hello world!" come back.
